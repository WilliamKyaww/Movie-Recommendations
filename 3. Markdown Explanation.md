# Collaborative Filtering Steps

## Step 1: Data Preprocessing

Before building a recommendation model, we must clean and prepare the dataset:
- Remove unnecessary columns (e.g., `timestamp`).
- Normalize ratings from a **0-5 scale** to a **0-1 scale**.
- Filter out movies without an IMDb ID to align with MovieLens data.
- Ensure all required data is correctly formatted.

## Step 2: Creating the User-Item Matrix

We transform our dataset into a matrix where:
- **Rows represent users**.
- **Columns represent movies**.
- **Cells contain ratings** (or NaN if no rating exists).

| User ID | Movie 1 | Movie 2 | Movie 3 | ... |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|-----|
| 1       | 4.0    |  NaN   | 3.5    | ... |
| 2       |  NaN   | 5.0    | 2.5    | ... |
| 3       | 3.0    | 4.0    |  NaN   | ... |

This matrix will be used to calculate similarities and make predictions.

## Step 3: Calculating Similarities

To recommend movies, we measure how similar users or movies are:
- **User-based similarity**: Find users with similar tastes.
- **Item-based similarity**: Find movies with similar rating patterns.
- Use **cosine similarity** or **Pearson correlation** to compare rows or columns in the user-item matrix.

## Step 4: Predicting Ratings

Once we identify similar users or movies, we estimate missing ratings:
- **User-based approach**: Predict a user's rating for a movie based on ratings from similar users.
- **Item-based approach**: Predict a rating based on how similar movies were rated.
- Use weighted averages to fill in missing values.

## Step 5: Evaluating Model Performance

To measure accuracy, we:
- **Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.**
- Use error metrics like **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** or **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** to compare actual vs. predicted ratings.
- A lower error means better recommendations.
