first version of md:

This is NOT completed by following any tutorial, but completed and actively self-learned with the help of LLMs.

As a novice programmer and an AI/ML enthusiast I have used my opportunity to enrich my understand of machine learning technologies 
The reason why there are a lot of markdown cells is so that I understand more of why I did what I did. 

 As this project serves primarily as an exploration and learning exercise, this approach provides better context for anyone reviewing or learning from the code.

Throughout the project, I've adopted a cell-specific import strategy, where libraries are introduced at the point of use rather than consolidating all imports at the beginning. This is for self learninig/educational value for myself so I can understand which libraries are required for which specific functionality. This makes it easier to understand the dependencies for individual operations.

I've also incorporated mark down cells before to explain the function and rationale of the revelant code that comes before or after these explanatory sections. I tried my best to be concise while also explaining the relevant information to avoid underexplaining important and hard-to-understand topics, as well as not to overexplain easy to understand basic topics.  



## SmartyPants

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|                |ASCII                          |HTML                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Single backticks|`'Isn't this fun?'`            |'Isn't this fun?'            |
|Quotes          |`"Isn't this fun?"`            |"Isn't this fun?"            |
|Dashes          |`-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash`|-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash|


## KaTeX

You can render LaTeX mathematical expressions using [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/):

The *Gamma function* satisfying $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\quad\forall n\in\mathbb N$ is via the Euler integral

$$
\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.
$$

## UML diagrams

You can render UML diagrams using [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/). For example, this will produce a sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob-->>John: How about you John?
Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
```

And this will produce a flow chart:

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Square Rect] -- Link text --> B((Circle))
A --> C(Round Rect)
B --> D{Rhombus}
C --> D
```
